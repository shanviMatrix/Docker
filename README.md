# Docker 🐳
This is my space for learning about something called Docker and later, Kubernetes. I'm just starting out, so this place will have all my notes and little practice things as I try to understand how they work. It's like my personal notebook where I'm figuring things out, step by step. If you're also new to this stuff, maybe this helps you too!
